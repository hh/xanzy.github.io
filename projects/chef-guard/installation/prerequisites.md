### Prerequisites
There are a few steps you need to take/execute before you can start installing and configuring Chef-Guard. Only the steps marked with a * are mandatory, the other steps are dependend on how you choose to configuration/setup Chef-Guard.

### *Chef Server version < 12 
Chef-Guard needs a valid Chef user account to talk to your Chef Server/Organization to [validate changes]({{ side.url }}/projects/chef-guard/introduction/monitoring_auditing.html#validating-changes). So you need to create a 'chef-guard' user with at least read rights to your Chef Server/Organization. Chef-Guard will never make any changes to your Chef environment, but will only request information about certain objects. Make sure you save the private key into a .pem file, as you will need this file while configuring Chef-Guard.

### *Chef-Client version >= 11.14.0
Because of a bug ([CHEF-5261](https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-5261){:target="_blank"}) in older clients, it is **strongly advised** to use at least version 11.14.0 in your environment. Older clients will work for the most part, but you will see some random Chef run failures. Also using certain knife commands (e.g. `knife cookbook list`) from a machine with an older client, will fail.

### Berkshelf version >= ??
When you want to use Chef-Guard for more than only monitoring and you are using Berkshelf to manage your cookbook dependencies, you will (until a next release) need to make a manual change to a single Berkshelf file. You will have to change line 102 (could maybe differ a little depending on the used Berkshelf version, but it is should be the return value of the `filtered_cookbooks` function) of file `berkshelf-3.1.x/lib/berkshelf/uploader.rb` from `cookbooks.values.sort` to just `cookbooks.values`. This will make sure the cookbooks are uploaded in their respective dependency order. And this in turn is needed when having dependencies on specific verisons that are uploaded during one and the same `berks upload` command. With the `sort` added here the upload will be done in alphabetical order instead which could break these Chef-Guard dependecies checks.

### Github
If you want Chef-Guard to [commit changes]({{ side.url }}/projects/chef-guard/introduction/monitoring_auditing.html#committing-changes) made to your Chef Server/Organization, you will need to create a Github repository into which Chef-Guard can commit the changes.

When using Open Source Chef you will need a single repo with the name 'config'. If instead you use Enterprise Chef, it probably makes more sense to create a dedicated 'chef-guard' Github organization with repos for every Chef Organization that you want Chef-Guard to monitor. In this case the names of the repos should be exactly the same as the 'Short Name' of you Chef Organizations.

After creating the needed repo(s) you will also need to [create an OAuth token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use){:target="_blank"} that Chef-Guard can use to authenticate with Github. Save both the OAuth token and the Github organization name where you created the repo(s), as you will need these later on when configuring Chef-Guard.

### Supermarket
When you have a local Supermarket installation and you want Chef-Guard to automatically [publish new cookbooks]({{ side.url }}/projects/chef-guard/introduction/cookbook_validation.html#publishing-the-cookbook), you will also need to create a Supermarket user. Currently this is not something you can do easily using a GUI. It will take some digging into the internals of Supermarket.

Internally we created just one user (called 'chef-guard') that manages all cookbook publications. For now, until Supermarket is more mature and ready for on premises use, this seems a feasible solution. You can manually add users by following this thread <https://github.com/opscode/supermarket/issues/425>.

_NOTE: The key we used to create the user was the public key of the already created Chef user. When using this public key to create the user, you will only need to save a single .pem file for your Chef-Guard configuration._
